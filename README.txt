Twitch BibleBot v0.1a

This is my BibleBot for Twitch. The purpose of this bot is to allow streamers to include a series of commands in their chats that will allow them to quickly have scripture input into their chat for their users to see. This project is open source, and may be used by any who find it useful to them. It is not however meant to be distributed by any other meaans.

This bot in its unpackaged form requires Python 2.7.13. You can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/

This also requires several additional libraries that may or may not come preloaded in your IDE. You can find these libraries in the header each of the files.

This project also uses two open source modules:
